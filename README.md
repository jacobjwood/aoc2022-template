# Advent of Code 2022 Template

## How to use

1. Clone this repo into your local directory. 
2. Copy your cookie from AOC 2022 into a file named session_cookie.txt (this is already listed in .gitignore).
3. In the terminal type `make day=X` where X is the day you want to run. This will create a folder for the day you specify and pull your text input for day X into the folder as well as create a python file that reads the input.
